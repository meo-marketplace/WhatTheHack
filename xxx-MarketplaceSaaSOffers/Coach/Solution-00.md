**[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Solution >](./Solution-01.md)

## Notes & Guidance

- There is a **configuration track** that requires limited code changes to configure the solution. 
- The **code track** requires the student to add code to and is more challenging.
- **Ensure the student is provided the appropriate .zip file for the track they are working on.** The code track Sample App
has code redacted that the student will need to add.
- There are a number of options to run the Emulator for the hack they should be running as a Node.js app through VS Code using the debugger, to minimise local configuration issues.

**Troubleshooting:**
- If there are any problems with Node.js check the student is in the correct terminal - CMD, Bash or WSL. 
- If there are any SSL errors check the student is using HTTP not HTTPS in the URL.
