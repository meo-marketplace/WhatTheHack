# Challenge 09 - Wrapping it all up

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-08.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Optional Challenge >](./Challenge-10.md)

## Introduction

Without the focus on updating code or configuration, this challenge is about wrapping up the experience and understanding getting ready to list in the Marketplace, the assets required and choices about user and license management.

## Description

For both tracks go through the hack from end to end.

- Create a new per user Offer and at least 2 plans in the Emulator  
| what will be completed in Partner Center
- Make a two purchases of the Offer  
| what would be completed in the Commercial Marketplace posting to your Landing Page:
  - one using the correct user and tenant details
  - one using the default Emulator user and tenant details
- Login to the Sample App SaaS page to view the entitlements  
| replicating the user's license management experience, possibly your own in app, or third party tool
- View the Entitlements page in the Sample App  
| Your license tracking across all customer tenants (you should see any entitlements against the default user and tenant made before authentication was enforced in the Emulator)
- In the Emulator > Subscriptions, run through the different elements of the subscription lifecycle

## Success Criteria

Now you have the experience, go list in the Marketplace!
