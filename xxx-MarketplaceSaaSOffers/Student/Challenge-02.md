# Challenge 02 - Emulate!

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-01.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-03.md)

## Introduction

The marketplace exposes a set of APIs - the SaaS Fulfillment APIs - for onboarding and managing the SaaS offer lifecyle
for your solution. To publish a transactable SaaS offer in the marketplace you must write code to integrate with these
APIs. This code will be resposible for informing the marketplace of changes of state and responding to messages from
the marketplace.

To integrate with the marketplace APIs you must use Partner Center to publish a SaaS offer to at least "preview"
stage. Rather than do this, we will use an emulator designed to emulate the behaviour of the SaaS Fulfillment APIs.
This makes it easy to make changes and doesn't require any special permissions in Partner Center.

## Description

## Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to:

- Verify that the IoT device boots properly after its thingamajig is configured.
- Verify that the thingamajig can connect to the mothership.
- Demonstrate that the thingamajic will not connect to the IoTProxyShip

## Tips

*This section is optional and may be omitted.*

*Add tips and hints here to give students food for thought. Sample IoT tips:*

- IoTDevices can fail from a broken heart if they are not together with their thingamajig. Your device will display a broken heart emoji on its screen if this happens.
- An IoTDevice can have one or more thingamajigs attached which allow them to connect to multiple networks.
